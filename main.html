    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. 
        Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms that can solve problems quickly without unnecessary computation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. 
        Analyzing space complexity allows programmers to design algorithms that use memory efficiently. 
        For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input.
