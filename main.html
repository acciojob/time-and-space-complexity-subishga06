    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial measure in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input size. This metric is used to design efficient solutions that perform well, even with large datasets.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm needs to run to completion. Analyzing <b>Space Complexity</b> is vital when working with embedded systems or environments with limited memory. The complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n).
