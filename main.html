    <h1>Understanding Algorithm Efficiency: Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        **Time complexity** is a crucial measure in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It doesn't measure actual execution time but rather the rate of growth of the running time. A goal of software development is to write algorithms that are **efficient**, meaning they can process large inputs quickly, often expressed using Big O notation.

    <p>
        **Space Complexity** refers to the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm needs to run to completion. This includes both the auxiliary space used by the algorithm (variables, temporary data structures) and the space taken by the input itself. Analyzing **Space Complexity** is vital when working with embedded systems or environments with limited memory. A common representation is Big O notation, such as **O(n)**, which means the space required grows linearly with the input size $n$.
