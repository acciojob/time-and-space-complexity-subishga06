  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity Analysis</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph 1: mentions Time complexity and efficient -->
  <p>
    Time complexity is used to estimate how long an algorithm will take to run for a given input size; designing efficient algorithms helps reduce runtime for large inputs.
  </p>

  <!-- Paragraph 2: contains exactly one <b> and mentions Space Complexity and O(n) -->
  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the additional memory required by an algorithm. When analyzing algorithms we often express this using Big O notation, for example O(n).
