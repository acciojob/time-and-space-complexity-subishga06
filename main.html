    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity Analysis of Algorithms</h1>

    <p>
        **Time complexity** measures how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the input size. This metric is used to design **efficient** solutions that perform well, even with large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        **Space Complexity** is the measure of the auxiliary memory an algorithm consumes. Analyzing **Space Complexity** helps manage memory usage, especially on constrained devices. The complexity is often expressed using Big O notation, such as **O(n)**.
